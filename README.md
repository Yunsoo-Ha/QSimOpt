## Traffic Light Problem 

The goal is to study the urban traffic signal control problem as a discrete-event simulation.  We explorea  network-based  design  and  verify  the  sample-path  behavior  of  the  average  cycle  time  as  the  objectivefunction.  We compare the performance of different Simulation Optimization solvers available on SimOptlibrary and discuss takeaways for traffic control structures. Here is [the paper](https://informs-sim.org/wsc20papers/363.pdf).
