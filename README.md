## Traffic Light Problem 

The goal is to study the urban traffic signal control problem as a discrete-event simulation.  We explorea  network-based  design  and  verify  the  sample-path  behavior  of  the  average  cycle  time  as  the  objectivefunction.  We compare the performance of different Simulation Optimization solvers available on SimOptlibrary and discuss takeaways for traffic control structures.
