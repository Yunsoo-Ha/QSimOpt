## Derivative Free Optimization 
### Adaptive Sampling Trust Region Optimization-Derivative Free (ASTRO-DF) with the Diagonal Hessian 
We consider unconstrained stochastic optimization problems in which the objective function value can only be observable by a Monte Carlo Simulation. We suppose that the derivative information is not directly available by a Monte Carlo Simulation. We present ASTRO-DF with a diagonal Hessian approximation, where a stochastic local model is iteratively constructed and optimized. The noticeable feature is that we can construct the stochastic underdetermined quadratic model as the stochastic local model with $\mathcal{O}(d)$ number of function evaluations.

# SimOpt Library
## Traffic Light Problem 
The goal is to study the urban traffic signal control problem as a discrete-event simulation.  We explorea  network-based  design  and  verify  the  sample-path  behavior  of  the  average  cycle  time  as  the  objectivefunction.  We compare the performance of different Simulation Optimization solvers available on SimOptlibrary and discuss takeaways for traffic control structures. Here is [the paper](https://informs-sim.org/wsc20papers/363.pdf).

## Python Simopt
We are trying to develop the SimOpt library by Python. We have developed the framework and also the oracle for various problems. 

## Quantum Amplitude Estimation
